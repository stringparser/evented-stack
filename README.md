# Stack

 Evented, Array styled, queue for node and the browser

### Why
  I wanted an array like queue with juicy behaviour and custom flow control.

### Usage
  What you get out of the module is an Array subClass. Inhertance from Array gives you all the array goodness. What is an observer pattern in order to make flow control possible. Events are fired on iterative `forEach`, `every` and `some` at the beginning, in between and end of each function evaluation.


  Note: you only can push functions to the array.
